# amrElm
An R package which implements a regularized version of ELM. Regularization is performed using a priori
spacial information expressed by an affinity matrix. The use of this type of a priori information
is similar to perform Tikhonov regularization. Furthermore, if a parameter free affinity matrix is
used, like the cosine similarity matrix, regularization is performed without any need for parameter
tunning. This version is applicable for binary classification problems.
